Some resources to learn Genetic-Algorithm

Similar to gradient descent algorithm, genetic algorithm is a kind of method which using iterative process.

A common genetic algorithm can be implemented by three steps:

*Step1*
Initialize lots of solution domin. 

*Step2*
Evaluate the all solution domain, keep brilliant solution domin and delete terrible solution domin.

*Step3*
initialize losts of solution domin from the brilliant solution of step2
